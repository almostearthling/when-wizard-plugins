# When Wizard Plugins

This repository contains plugins for the **When Wizard** that, for various reasons, didn't make it into the base plugin library. The main reason is that these plugins might use some "tricks" to achieve their results, but other needs, such as leaving the stock plugin set small enough, concur in the decision to separate these ones from the main **When Wizard** project. Moreover, these plugins make good examples for further plugin development.

Plugins will be provided mostly in separate directories each, unless two or more are strictly related (such as in the case of the *Confluence* plugin).

The `DIST` folder contains packaged distributions of the plugins, that can be downloaded and installed using the **When Wizard Manager** utility.
